# web-scrapping-with-python

1) Ndtv.py - It is the python script which I wrote to get the latest headlines of the world news as notifications. I scrapped the NDTV news channel's website.

2) Tech.py - It is the python script which I wrote to get the latest Technology buzz from around the world. I used fossbytes.com for scrapping. 

3) attendance.py - This script is really easy and it was my one of the starting scripts while I was learning web scrapping. I scrapped my college'e website and on running this script I can fetch the my attendance data. I've also used regex to fetch out the desired data.

4) cricknotif.py - It is the python script which I wrote to get live cricket scores as a notification on my desktop. I've used cricbuzz for scrapping.
